## Overview
The Laptop Price Predictor is a machine learning project that predicts the prices of laptops based on their specifications and features. It utilizes a dataset of laptops with various attributes such as processor speed, RAM size, storage capacity, graphics card, etc. The project is implemented using Python, scikit-learn for model training, and Streamlit for building the user interface.

## Features
- Import and preprocess laptop dataset
- Train a machine learning model to predict laptop prices
- Explore and analyze the laptop dataset
- Interactive web interface using Streamlit
- Predict the price of a laptop based on user-provided specifications
- Display feature importance for price prediction
- Visualize and compare actual vs. predicted prices

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/laptop-price-predictor.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd laptop-price-predictor`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Ensure you have the laptop dataset in the appropriate format (CSV, Excel, etc.).
2. Modify the configuration file (`config.json`) to specify the dataset file path and other settings.
3. Run the Streamlit application: `streamlit run app.py`
4. Open the provided URL in your web browser to access the application.
5. Use the provided options and sliders to input the laptop specifications.
6. Click the "Predict" button to generate a price prediction.
7. Explore the feature importance chart to understand the key factors influencing the price.
8. View the actual vs. predicted prices in the visualization.

## Data Format
The laptop dataset should be in a tabular format, such as CSV or Excel, with each row representing a laptop and each column representing a feature. The dataset should include the target variable, which is the laptop price.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- streamlit
